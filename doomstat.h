 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   All the global variables that store the internal state.
 *   Theoretically speaking, the internal state of the engine
 *    should be found by looking at the variables collected
 *    here, and every relevant module will have to include
 *    this header file.
 *   In practice, things are a bit messy.
